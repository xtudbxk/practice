And the version of Python should larger than 3.6 for the case of f-formating strings.

### Run

After installing all the libs, you can run the RedBlackTree.py by simple `python RedBlackTree.py`

The scirpt would generates a pdf under the folder. And you can see the visualization of the RedBlackTree in the file.
